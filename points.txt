What is top level class in C#?
Top-level statements allows you to write executable code directly at the root of a file,
eliminating the need for wrapping your code in a class or method.
This means you can create programs without the ceremony of a Program class and a Main method.


Top-level statements are excellent for simplifying smaller applications.
They might not work well in large or complex apps that need the extra structure.
